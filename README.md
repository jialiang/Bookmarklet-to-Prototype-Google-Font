# Bookmarklet-to-Prototype-Google-Font
A small bookmarklet I use to quickly prototype how fonts from Google Font looks on my website.

## Workflow

- Install `bookmarklet.js` as a bookmarklet.
- Visit [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) to look for suitable fonts.
- Copy the font name.
- Go to your website and click on the bookmarklet.
- Paste the font name in the pop up that appears.
- The font file is added to your website and the font family of the body is set to the font you entered.

You can also enter the corresponding number to switch to previously added font family.
