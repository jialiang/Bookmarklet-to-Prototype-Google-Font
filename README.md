# Bookmarklet-to-Prototype-Google-Font
A small bookmarklet I use to quickly prototype how fonts from Google Font looks on my website.

## Workflow

- Install bookmarklet.
- Open Google Font to look for suitable fonts.
- Copy the font name.
- Go to your website and click on the bookmarklet.
- Enter the font name in the pop up that appears.
- Font file is added to your website and the font family of the body is set to the font you entered.
